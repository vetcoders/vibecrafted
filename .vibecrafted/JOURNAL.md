# Operator Journal

This is the append-only, repository-local decision journal for the active
Vibecrafted Operator. Workers do not write here. Runtime telemetry, raw
transcripts, secrets, private prompts, and routine negative activity do not
belong here.

- Decision: keep one tracked operator journal at
  `<repo-root>/.vibecrafted/JOURNAL.md`.
- Ownership: the Operator records material decisions, dispatches, recoveries,
  integrations, security guardrails, and deviations from ITP or TD.
- Worker boundary: Workers surface falsifiable findings to the Operator and do
  not opportunistically repair adjacent scope or write this journal.
- Runtime boundary: every other file under `<repo-root>/.vibecrafted/` remains
  ignored local state.
