# keychain-session.sh — an ephemeral signing keychain that always gives the
# operator's search list back
# ============================================================================
# BORN FROM (2026-08-15, P0): a normal Codescribe run popped
#
#   "Codescribe wants to use the 'Vibecrafted-signing' keychain"
#
# and the login password did not open it, because it was not the login
# keychain. The host's user domain looked like this:
#
#   search list: "/private/tmp/vibecrafted-release-3.7.1.rki1gq/.../Vibecrafted-signing.keychain-db"
#                "/Users/<op>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db"
#   default:     "/private/tmp/vibecrafted-release-3.7.1.rki1gq/.../Vibecrafted-signing.keychain-db"
#
# A release had prepended its ephemeral signing keychain to the *user* search
# list and made it the *default* keychain. Measured at the time: the keychain
# file still existed and the release (`build-vibecrafted-release.sh`, pid
# 66496) was still running. So this was not only a cleanup bug — the host was
# poisoned WHILE the release was healthy and mid-flight, and it would have
# stayed poisoned for the whole run.
#
# FOUR FAILURES PRODUCED IT, and this file exists to make all four impossible:
#
# 0. Taking the login session's default keychain. `security default-keychain
#    -d user -s` is global to the login session, not scoped to the release
#    shell. Every other process — Codescribe included — then resolves to the
#    release's keychain first and prompts for a uuidgen password nobody has.
#    Signing does not need it: import, set-key-partition-list, find-identity
#    and codesign all take the keychain path explicitly. => We do NOT set the
#    default keychain unless KEYCHAIN_SESSION_SET_DEFAULT=1 says so, and the
#    restore path below exists for domains an older run already took over.
#
# 1. "delete-keychain also unlists it." It does — but only while the file is
#    still there. Put the ephemeral keychain under `mktemp -d` (which is what
#    the release did) and the directory can vanish first; `delete-keychain`
#    then fails, the `|| true` swallows it, and the search-list entry is
#    immortal. => We ALWAYS unlist explicitly, and we unlist BEFORE deleting.
#
# 2. `trap cleanup EXIT` alone. Bash runs an EXIT trap for normal and error
#    exits, but a Ctrl-C or a SIGTERM during a 30-minute notarization wait can
#    tear the shell down without it. => We trap EXIT INT TERM HUP, and the
#    handler is idempotent so double delivery is harmless.
#
# 3. Snapshot-and-restore under concurrency. Naive restore is itself a
#    contamination source:
#      A snapshots [login]        -> list [tempA, login]
#      B snapshots [tempA, login] -> list [tempB, tempA, login]
#      A restores its snapshot    -> list [login]           (tempB dropped, B breaks)
#      B restores its snapshot    -> list [tempA, login]    (tempA RESURRECTED, dead path)
#    => We never write a remembered list back. Restore means "read the current
#    list, remove exactly the entry this session created, write the rest."
#    In a single run that reproduces the prior list exactly; under concurrency
#    nobody clobbers anybody. The snapshot is kept for the default-keychain
#    decision and for the doctor's forensics, not as a thing to replay.
#
# The snapshot is stored as one NUL-terminated path per record — never as a
# shell-concatenated string. The predecessor did
#   existing="$(security list-keychains -d user | tr -d '"' | tr '\n' ' ')"
#   security list-keychains -d user -s "$TEMP" $existing
# which splits any keychain path containing a space into two nonexistent
# entries, and strips every space out of the default keychain path besides.
#
# Usage (sourceable — the release path):
#   . scripts/lib/keychain-session.sh
#   keychain_session_begin codescribe-signing   # arms the traps itself
#   security import ... -k "$KEYCHAIN_SESSION_PATH" ...
#   codesign --keychain "$KEYCHAIN_SESSION_PATH" ...
#   keychain_session_end                        # optional; traps cover it
#
# Usage (executable — for CI step boundaries, where each `run:` block is its
# own shell and traps cannot span them):
#   scripts/lib/keychain-session.sh begin <label> [dir]  → prints keychain path
#   scripts/lib/keychain-session.sh end   <label> [dir]  → unlists + deletes
#   scripts/lib/keychain-session.sh path  <label> [dir]  → prints keychain path
#
# The ephemeral password is generated here, never echoed, never written to the
# transcript, and lives only in the session state file (mode 0600). No
# identity, certificate, or environment secret is ever printed by this file.
#
# `security` is reached through $KEYCHAIN_SESSION_SECURITY_BIN so the
# regression suite can substitute a fake and assert the exact argv this file
# produces without touching a real keychain. Tests:
#   scripts/tests/keychain-session-test.sh   (make test-keychain-session)
# Read-only diagnosis of a host already poisoned by an older release:
#   scripts/keychain-doctor.sh
